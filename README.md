# struct-person-list-example

This is a simple example of the opaque struct pattern in c .
person_t can be used like an object. The objects can be stored in an person_list_t object.
Dynamic memory allocation is used for most of the stuff.


## Output:
```
person: Dominik Knoll is 32 years old.
person_list = [
		person: Dominik Knoll is 32 years old.
		person: Klaus Kleber is 66 years old.
		person: Petra Schmitt is 35 years old.
	]
	person: Klaus Kleber is 66 years old.
```
